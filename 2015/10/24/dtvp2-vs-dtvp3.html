      <h1>DTVP-2 vs DTVP-3: A Worthwhile Upgrade?</h1>
      <div class="date">24 Oct, 2015</div>
      <div id="main" role="main">
        <p><p>The <em>Developmental Test of Visual Perception (DTVP)</em> has been around a long time. It was 
developed my Marianne Frostig and colleagues in the early 1960s, and first standardised in 1963.
The DTVP-2 was released in 1993, and most recently, the Third Edition of the DTVP
was published by <a href="http://www.proedinc.com/customer/ProductView.aspx?ID=5697&amp;sSearchWord="><u>Pro-Ed</u></a>
in 2014 with updated norms. But has much really changed?</p>

<p><img alt="Examiner Record Booklets" src="/2015/10/24/dtvp2-vs-dtvp3/dtvp2vsdtvp3.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can find the "official" list of changes on the publisher's website, so I'm 
not going to repeat that, but instead share my experience.
My workplace has purchased the DTVP-3 at the start of 2015. At first glance, it 
appeared to me that the packaging had just been made more colourful, and a few 
of the subtests removed. However, having now used it, I am thankful for the small 
changes that have made the assessment much easier to administer.</p>

<p>Things to like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Visual-Motor Speed and Position in Space subtests are gone! I used to get 
frustrated marking these, as the marking criteria was very strict about where the 
pencil marks were allowed to be. I felt the children were losing marks unfairly,
as the aim of the Speed subtest is to mark as many shapes as possible, but the shape
wouldn't count if the mark protuded outside the shape.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">Removed Subtests: Visual-Motor Speed and Spatial Relations</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Not only has removal of three subtests (Position in Space, Spatial Relations, 
and Visual-Motor Speed) meant shorter administration time, the change in order
has helped test administration run more smoothly. No longer do we need to switch 
between the response booklet and the stimulus booklet for each subtest.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The layout of the Examiner record form has become much more user-friendly. It
now includes the standard wording for explaining the tasks, and the responses are
much easier to instantly mark correct or incorrect by the bolding of correct responses.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">Completely new layout of the Examiner Record Booklet</p>

<ul>
  <li>The layout of the Response Booklet has been improved. There is now more space between items.
Some of the pictures in the Eye-Hand Coordination Subtest have changed, fairly inconsequentially.
The Copying Subtest has been reordered to better reflect the developmental progression of
drawing skills. Scoring this subtest has also been much improved with provision of
a Scoring Template, which includes all the necessary angles and measuring lines for accurate scoring.</li>
</ul>

<p class="caption">Improvements to the Copying Subtest</p>

<ul>
  <li>Even the Stimulus Booklet has had a facelift. It now includes the letters corresponding to
the answers, under each figure. I've found it useful to double-check sometimes if
the child points too quickly by saying "was that 'B' and 'F'?" There are some new items,
and all the items now have the potential answers layed out in a single row.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Norms are now provided up to 12 years 11 months. I find this very convenient,
because the same assessment can be used in early primary school, and again for 
comparison around the age of transition to high school.</li>
</ul>

<p>Things to question:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Although this assessment has been around a long time, we are yet to have international
standardisation. The DTVP-3 boasts impressive reliability and "is shown to be unbiased 
relative to race, gender, and handedness." Is it valid for use with Australian children?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was the removal of the Spatial Relations subtest beneficial? Was that data useful?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now there is no component taking into account the speed of visual-motor integration tasks.
Is speed of completion relevant in assessing proficiency? I would have thought so.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
