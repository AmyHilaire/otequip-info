    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Changes to the IR35 Intermediaries legislation, coming into effect for the 2017/2018 tax year, mean that working as an OT locum through a limited company is no longer an attractive option for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the six weeks before I left Australia to start working in the UK, the agencies
started asking "Are you going with an umbrella company or a limited company?"
I was completely puzzled at why I needed either of them. How do they work?
What's the difference? And no one would give any guidance due to legal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why do you NEED to choose one or the other?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working as a locum in the UK, you are a contractor. That is, you need to be
self-employed. The organisation you work for (e.g. the NHS or Social Services)
doesn't employ you, and the recruitment agency doesn't employ you. The organisation
contracts the agency to provide them with workers, and the agency contracts you,
the worker, to provide the service for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you need a legal entity to act as your 'employer'. You can do it yourself, through
a Limited Company. Or you can have someone else do it for you: an Umbrella Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="So many choices!" src="/2017/02/04/limited-company/girl-umbrella-bridge1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What is the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is in how you get paid, and your legal rights and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umbrella Company:&lt;/em&gt; You are an employee of the umbrella company. You submit your
timesheet and claimable expenses to the umbrella company. Your gross pay goes from
the agency to the umbrella company. They take out taxes and their fees.
They deposit your net pay into your bank account. I chose to set up my own limited company,
so I don't have any first-hand experience of umbrella companies. As you are an employee,
many umbrella company provide sick pay and other statutory benefits.
Some also include insurance cover and pension schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limited Company:&lt;/em&gt; You are the sole employee, director and 100% shareholder of a 
limited company. See the diagram below. The recruitment agency pays your company,
and your company pays you (you pay yourself) salary, dividends, and reimbursable 
expenses. Your company pays Corporation Tax. You are your own employer. 
You are 100% legally responsible for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Limited Company Diagram" src="/2017/02/04/limited-company/GettingPaid1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Red = requests for payment, Black = payments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know. It looks very confusing. It took me a little while to get my head around
how to process all the paperwork! I'm really glad to be with &lt;a href="https://incomemadesmart.com/"&gt;Income Made Smart (IMS)&lt;/a&gt;.
They helped me set up my company, and provide mentoring whenever I need it. They've been very helpful.
If you decide to use their service, please say I (Amy Hilaire) referred you. That would
really help to fund this blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, a limited company gives you more responsibility. I am the sole director
of my limited company. Therefore, it's my responsibility to ensure my company is
compliant with all legislation regarding employment and taxes etc. It seems complicated,
but IMS help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How to choose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it's really down to personal preference, and risk versus return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good umbrella company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces your risk, because their trained professionals take care of all your tax etc and all you have to worry about is how to spend your take-home pay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces your return (income). From what I've heard, umbrella companies charge a lot for their service, and your take-home pay is less than if you have a limited company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces your admin time a little. You still have to submit your timesheet and your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limited company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases your return. You're not paying anyone else to do admin for you. Your tax is generally less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I pay weekly fees to IMS to help me manage my company, but I believe this is much less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases your risk, as you get no sick pay or included insurance, so it's up to you to keep savings aside for this. And you may have a personal tax bill at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases your options. For example, my company bought a laptop for me to use, pre-tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Words of Warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do your own research.&lt;/em&gt; It's very easy just to go with recommendations from your agency to find help with setting
up a limited company, or an umbrella companies to sign up with. Keep in mind
that the agencies get referral bonuses and may refer you to the companies that
pay the most for referrals rather than the one that is in your best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The most important thing I learnt from the SPD University Miller Function and
Participation Scales webinars is that this assessment relies on the &lt;strong&gt;therapist’s clinical judgement&lt;/strong&gt; 
in the administration and scoring. Dr Lucy J Miller and
Dr Sarah Schoen, who ran the e-learning courses made it clear that the assessment is
supposed to be fun, and the goal is to get the child’s
best performance. And they mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started administrating the M-FUN, I was overly precise to avoid 
jeopardising the validity of the standardised results. I’ve
learnt now that the test was standardised in a way that means you &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;
change things to suit the child without breaching standard administration.
For example, if a child is fatiguing significantly, you can split the assessment
into several sessions. You can change the order of the items so snack time comes
earlier if the child needs a break. Wow - it's such a relief to have this flexibility within a standardised assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webinars included video examples. I found it useful to see other
therapists administering the assessment, though the videos were focused on
the children rather than the therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt that the M-FUN is designed to follow the ICF framework by measuring Body Structure and Function
(through the Foundations Profile), Activity (VM / FM / GM Performance measures) 
and Participation (Observations Checklists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="diagram" src="/2016/09/23/MFUN-elearning/ICFandMFUN.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is what I learnt to help combat the difficulties I was initially having
with the M-FUN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;While theoretically, this assessment can be done in a variety of settings (clinic,
home, school, etc.), this isn't always easy. I have found the gross motor section
difficult, as it requires prior set-up of measured lines and markers, and it requires
a smooth wall with a concrete floor against which a ball can be kicked for "Soccer".
I've been unable to locate an appropriate wall at several locations (homes and schools).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I’m not the only person with this issue. In the clinic-based assessment
sessions shown in the webinars, the therapists were using a long hallway for the
soccer section. To me, it didn’t look like 12 feet away – but if that’s acceptable,
it makes my life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If one item in a performance domain can't be completed, a standard
score for the domain cannot be calculated. Therefore, if the only suitable wall
becomes unavailable (e.g. it starts raining) for the Soccer game, a standardised
GM score can't be obtained even for the upper body items, and the time you've spent
on the rest of the GM section becomes much less useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of options to combat this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come back and do it again another day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use your observations to comment on the parts the child completed. It’s not all about the scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;To administer this assessment, you have to be very organised. There
are many different resources to juggle, and the examiner's attention is constantly
split between observing the child, checking the administration directions, scoring,
and keeping time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel much less stressed about this now. When doing the assessment, it is assumed
that you will know it well enough not to need the administration directions in
front of you – there are hints on the score sheet, and the wording doesn’t have
to be used word for word, it’s just to give you the gist. Lucy and Sarah also
commented several times on how useful videoing sessions can be so you can complete scoring afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="So much writing" src="/2016/09/23/MFUN-elearning/writing.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 4:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Because the children enjoy the assessment items, they want to finish
their work. I like children to finish their work too, but the time limits are
very short for the children I work with, and it's very difficult to stop them
half way through every single item! It's not great for rapport or for their sense
of accomplishment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this, I have been allowing the children to finish their work (in most
cases) and trying to note when the time ran out. As it turns out, this is what
we’re expected to do. You want the children to feel good about their efforts and
continue to do their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 5:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I've found it takes more preparation time than other assessments,
and it takes longer to score, compared to something simpler like the DTVP-3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still true. I don’t think there’s really a way around it, due to the M-FUN's comprehensive nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 6:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It's American. For example, one of the Classroom Observations
Checklist items is about whether the child can carry their tray in the cafeteria.
This isn't relevant in most Australian schools. I've modified this item to be
"manages lunch box independently."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, that’s probably not going to change anytime soon. However, with the
guiding principals of the assessment in mind, such as basing on the ICF framework,
and focusing on measuring the child's best performance, I feel more justified in
modifying a few items to be more culturally or environmentally relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;* * *&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the webinars very helpful. I would recommend them as essential
viewing for anyone administering the M-FUN. You can find them &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://spduniversity.org/2013/05/13/session-2-administration-and-scoring-of-the-m-fun/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original review of the M-FUN assessment is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://otequip.info/2016/01/13/mfun.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my thoughts. Please share yours below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The UK is an attractive base for young Australians and New Zealanders
to gain international professional experience, while travelling the world. 
Locumming makes this dream a reality. In the UK, locum roles are filled through recruitment agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Locum?&lt;/strong&gt; The term 'locum' refers to a person filling a role on a temporary basis. 
'Locumming' is when a contract worker uses short term contracts as a source of income. 
Locum work generally has a higher hourly pay rate, but doesn't include employment 
benefits such as sick leave, annual leave, or insurance.
Locum work is purely paid by the hour, like a casual employee. If you don't work, you don't get paid. 
On the flipside, the locum can choose to take time off at times that suit them, 
and contracts can be ended with one week notice. Locums fill in maternity leave positions,
complete short-term projects, or fill a role quickly while a permanent employee is recruited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use an Agency?&lt;/strong&gt; In order to do locum work, registering with at least one agency 
is essential. Agencies also provide helpful advice on moving, particularly if you don't know 
anyone in the UK, and/or haven't been there before (like me).
Most of the locums I've talked to are registered with up to three. There are a few reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the agencies have many of the same jobs, some may specialise in different areas (geographical or organisational) and have roles that other agencies don't.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Larger agencies are generally useful for getting settled, as they have more staff and sometimes organise social events etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smaller agencies may offer a slightly higher pay rate, so that you take the position through them rather than a larger agency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you become a limited company (which most locums do) you will need to show that you are working as an independent contractor rather than as an employee. Working for more than one agency in the tax year makes your tax clearer in regards to IR35 (I will explain limited companies in another post).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Communication Diagram" src="/2016/09/07/working-holiday3/GettingWorkS.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Communication channels for locum work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three agencies I’ve come across the most are &lt;a href="http://www.sugarman.co.uk/clients/specialisms/occupational-therapy"&gt;Sugarman&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="http://www.justot.co.uk/"&gt;JustOT/JustPhysio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.yourworldhealthcare.com/uk/professions/occupational-therapy"&gt;Your World&lt;/a&gt;. I’m registered with the first two, and I am well looked after. 
I also tried to register with a different one, but they lost contact. The NHS puts the agencies on different tiers, and prefer to deal with the ones at the top 
(which includes Sugarman and JustOT, and probably others), because they and their 
candidates (us) comply with strict NHS quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registering with an agency&lt;/strong&gt; initially is quite easy: you just need to contact them, 
send in your resume, and let them know your plans. They will allocate you a consultant 
who will usually be keen to keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing the full registration is a bit more involved. This is what I had to submit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Birth certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marriage certificate (to prove change of name)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HCPC Registration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;University degree certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List of residential addresses covering the last 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete employment history (starting from my first job in high school)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form to account for any gaps in employment of one month or more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Australian Federal Police check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declaration that none of the members of my household have been convicted of criminal activities involving children&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agency application form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health declaration form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of childhood immunization (polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hep A, diphtheria, whooping cough) and appropriate boosters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of Hep B vaccination &amp;amp; immunity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of varicella immunity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of TB vaccination&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK police check (DBS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 proofs of UK address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National Insurance number (UK)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK company and bank details&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photo for ID card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certificate of completion of Mandatory Training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a pain to send in all this stuff by email, then also show them the originals. 
&lt;strong&gt;Advice: stay organised.&lt;/strong&gt; The consultants will keep you up to date with what they 
still need from you, but sometimes they forget or lose things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I finally completed and submitted all these things, I was labelled &lt;strong&gt;“Compliant”&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Oh, happy day! Now I can be contracted to work anywhere in the NHS quickly and easily, through either agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is long enough without going into more details. If you have questions, please ask :-)&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While Australian health professionals are rarely denied 
registration, the application is definitely &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; quick and easy. I started the process 
in July 2015, and was granted my registration on 9th February, 2016. 
From start to finish, my application took about &lt;strong&gt;7 months&lt;/strong&gt;.
It doesn’t “usually” take that long, but it easily can. To work in the United Kingdom 
as an Occupational Therapist, Physiotherapist, 
Speech &amp;amp; Language Therapist, Paramedic, Clinical Scientist, Dietician, Podiatrist,
Psychologist, Social Worker, or other allied health professional, Health and Care Professions 
Council (HCPC) registration is essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The HCPC have virtually the same role as the Australian Health Practitioners Regulation 
Agency (AHPRA). They ensure that health professionals uphold quality standards and follow the law. 
To be registered to practice in the UK, you need to apply to the HCPC. I was told the process 
can take up to six months, so I completed my HCPC application as the first step in 
process of moving. I didn't want to book flights etc, and then find that I'd be unable 
to work as an OT.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HCPC London" src="/2016/07/11/working-holiday2/hcpc-london.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I completed my Occupational Therapy degree in Australia, so I had to complete an 
International application for registration. The application form is available on 
the &lt;a href="http://www.hcpc-uk.org/apply/international/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HCPC website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and includes a 
list of what needs to be submitted. Keep in mind that the requirements could change 
and I am writing this about my own experience, so be sure to follow the HCPC guidance 
notes, which can be found following the application form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Parts of the application:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Application Form:&lt;/em&gt; This is about 12 pages that I had to fill in about myself.&lt;br /&gt;
My contact details etc., were fairly straightforward. Providing information about 
my previous OT jobs strained my brain a bit, and having to handwrite it on the 
application form feels like extra pressure to get it right the first time. When describing my previous OT roles, 
I just wrote a simple introductory sentence, followed by a list of what my work involved. The lists included the client 
group, assessments (formal and informal), interventions, evaluation, and extra things 
like group programs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Course Details Form:&lt;/em&gt; This may sound easy, but it's actually quite complicated. 
It must be completed by the university, in my case, the 
University of Queensland. They have staff in the therapies admin team who take care 
of these forms. It cost $165 and I had to provide details of all prac experiences 
(including first and second years) and electives. UQ sent me a form to fill out, to 
enable them to complete their form. The HCPC aren't interested in your academic 
transcript, but it might be handy to refer to this to check all your elective subjects 
are correct. It took a week or two for UQ to complete the form once I had provided all my course details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professional References:&lt;/em&gt; This can be tricky if you’re trying not to inform your 
current employer about your intention to move overseas, but you need someone from 
your most recent workplace to complete the reference, such as a team leader or senior OT. 
The application form provides two reference forms and says you need to submit at least 
one. I had been in the same job for a few years, and my work was quite classic OT
practice, so I just submitted one, completed by my team leader, a physiotherapist. 
I think the point of this form is to prove that you are working as an occupational 
therapist in a "safe and effective" manner. If I was working in a role that wasn’t 
a traditional OT role, or if "Occupaitonal Therapist" wasn't my job title, I might've 
got a second reference from a previous job to show I had “traditional” OT skills.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Personal Reference:&lt;/em&gt;  I asked a family friend, who is a church minister, to complete 
this part for me. There is a list of who can vouch for you as an upstanding citizen on the form.
The difficult part of this was just posting the form back and forwards, since they didn't live near me.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Certificate of professional status from the regulator in the country where you last practised”:&lt;/em&gt; 
This sounds complicated, but is very easy. There is a short form to fill out on the 
AHPRA website. It costs $50. They send the certificate directly to HCPC, electronically. 
I did this step aroundnthe time I posted the rest of the application so there wouldn't 
be too much of a gap between the two things arriving.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Payment (“Scrutiny Fee”) form:&lt;/em&gt; Fill out your credit card details or send a cheque/money 
order. Keep in mind that this will be an international transaction, in GBP, so you 
might want to check the conditions of your credit card to make sure you don’t get 
a nasty surprise. The fee is £495, which was about AU$1,000 when I applied.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Certified Copies of Important Documents:&lt;/em&gt; Be sure to read the guidance notes 
carefully on this one, as they need to be recently certified and have specific wording 
in the certification. They require:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Two identifying documents (e.g. passport / birth certificate / driver’s licence).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you have changed your name, certified evidence of this needs to be submitted (e.g. marriage certificate).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certified copy of your qualification certificate (OT degree)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Background Check Consent Form:&lt;/em&gt; I just filled it in and signed it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application form took me about 6-8 weeks to fully complete and submit. I sent 
the form to London by Australia Post’s CourierPost service, which offers a door 
to door tracking service. Then I waited about nine weeks, and nothing happened. 
I was really worried because the payment hadn’t been taken (which is meant to be 
the first step in the process).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Communication Breakdown&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I emailed them to check the status of my application, they reported they had 
emailed me earlier about the payment. I didn’t receive an email. Anyway, the cost 
of application processing changed after I signed the credit card payment authorisation, 
so that page was instantly shredded. I had to give my card details again, over a 
crackly international phone line. The payment went through instantly. The woman 
I first spoke to made a comment like “it’s a good thing they’ve actually got on 
with processing your application and not just left it sitting here waiting for payment.” 
But the next one said “Your application should be processed within twelve weeks.” 
I also got a letter in the post about a week later, saying again that it should 
be processed within twelve weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleven weeks went by and I heard nothing. I emailed them again to check the status. 
Apparently. they had posted me a letter only two weeks after my payment to say 
that my application was approved, and I needed to phone them to arrange payment 
of my registration. I had not received the letter (though this was probably not 
HCPC’s fault, it happened with other mail too).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I phoned them, paid my registration fee, and I was so very relieved when my HCPC 
occupational therapy registration certificate and card arrived in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="HCPC Registered" src="/2016/07/11/working-holiday2/New-HCPC-Logo.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cost of Registration:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Applying for registration in the UK was more expensive than I expected. 
Here is the breakdown of my costs, in Australian dollars:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UQ Course Details Form Fee (money order): $173.95&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;AHPRA Certificate Fee: $50&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Postage to London (CourierPost with tracking): $54.10&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;Application Scrutiny Fee: $1,072.58 (£495)&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;UK Registration Fee: $371.28, (£180) valid for 2 years&lt;/li&gt;
  
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Total: $1,721.91&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's the story of how I got my HCPC registration. I hope that your story is 
short and sweet. Please post any questions and I'll try to reply quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or was your experience different to mine? Please share…&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;While studying Occupational Therapy at university, it became clear that working 
in the UK or Ireland for a couple of years was a very common thing for OTs to do. 
It’s a well trodden path. It sounded so easy: just get a couple of years'
experience, and head on over there! It might even be a way of earning seniority 
more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="London" src="/2016/06/26/working-holiday1/london1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ever since I was a child, living overseas was one of my dreams. Growing up in Australia,
as a descendant of white invaders, I felt somewhat disconnected from parts of my
cultural heritage. We have developed a new heritage in Australia, which I love, but
not all of it makes sense. For example, Christmas is one of my favourite times of the year.
It’s normally sunny and humid. Backyard cricket is enjoyed with beer in hand, even when a
summer storm looms. Meanwhile, the cooks of the family are slaving away in a stuffy
kitchen over a hot stove to prepare the traditional baked ham/turkey/pork/chicken
or all the the above, with baked vegetables, while singing along to “I’m dreaming
of a white Christmas” and “dashing through the snow in a one horse open sleigh”. 
It just doesn’t add up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My husband and I decided in 2015 that the following year, 2016, was the time to 
make our move. The process involved applying for UK registration as an OT, applying
for visas, finding work, organising ourselves and our belongings, and working out
what to do about all those important extra bits and pieces, like insurance, phones,
etc. While most of it was fairly straightforward, it was difficult to find information
about what to do and when. For such a well trodden path, it doesn't seem particularly
well documented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here is my story of moving from Australia to have a working holiday in the UK.
Since there is so much to write, it will be a 5 part series of posts. If you are
planning to do this, or something similar, be warned: there is a risk of drowning
in paperwork!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the main steps involved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get your UK Occupational Therapy registration with the HCPC&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work out your plan (e.g. when will you finish work in Australia, fly over to UK, will you have a holiday in between… etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get your UK visa (if needed)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Register with recruitment agencies and proving your compliance with NHS policies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find somewhere to live, get settled in, start work, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have questions, please ask! Just remember that I’m not providing any
professional advice here, only sharing my experience, and the experiences others
have shared with me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Miller Function &amp; Participation Scales (M-FUN-PS) Review</title>
    <link rel="alternate" href="http://blog.url.com/2016/01/13/mfun.html"/>
    <id>http://blog.url.com/2016/01/13/mfun.html</id>
    <published>2016-01-13T00:00:00+00:00</published>

    <author>
      <name>Article Author</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Miller Function and Participation Scales (M-FUN-PS) is a standardised developmental 
assessment for children aged 2 years and 6 months, to 7 years and 11 months. It
covers three motor domains: visual motor (VM), fine motor (FM), and gross motor (GM),
as well as participation. The M-FUN-PS was authored by Dr Lucy Miller, a very 
experienced occupational therapist and researcher. 
Dr Miller has done a lot of work in the area of sensory processing disorder (SPD),
and has founded the SPD Foundation, the STAR Centre for SPD treatment, and the SPD
University, which provides online education to caregivers, the community, and health professionals. The M-FUN-PS
was published by &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pearsonclinical.com.au/products/view/143#tabs=0"&gt;Pearson Clinical&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in 2006,
and can be purchased through the Pearson website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="M-FUN-PS Administration Directions" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/manual.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've been using the M-FUN-PS (or M-FUN for short) for about 18 months. We decided 
to purchase the M-FUN as a replacement for our old Peabody Developmental Motor Scales,
which had pieces missing and included some rather out-dated activities (which some may call "classic",
but we were finding children commonly found test materials unfamiliar). We wanted an
assessment that could provide detailed results for parents and teachers, with the child's transition
to school in mind. The main purpose for this assessment in my setting has been to
prepare for or assist the child's transition to their first year of formal schooling
("Prep" in Queensland).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M-FUN is split into two age levels, 2yrs 6mths until the child turns 4, then 4yrs
until the child turns 8. As transition to school occurs in Queensland between 5yrs 6mths
and 6yrs 6mths, I have never administered the younger version of the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Comparison of age groups" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/bunnies-puppies.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The two age groups complete the same items, with the tasks
simplified accordingly for the younger group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, it's quite a long and detailed assessment
to consider administering with such a young age group, particularly with children who have
developmental delays. Even the younger version includes letter writing, which I would
consider to be developmentally beyond that age group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Workbook covers" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/workbooks.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;The workbooks and examiner forms are different for the lower 
and upper age ranges. The covers and layout are very motivating for children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M-FUN kit includes many motivating and familiar items for children. The manipulatives (below)
come with the M-FUN set, or you can put together your own set by following the list in
the assessment manual. We found that we needed to replace some of the included items
with locally sources items, which worked better. For example, the "soft modelling clay"
included in our kit was rock hard, and even the therapists had trouble moulding it.
We have replaced it with standard plasticine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="M-FUN Manipulatives" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/manipulatives.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M-FUN domains (Visual Motor, Fine Motor, and Gross Motor) are made up of multiple
games each. Each game is like a subtest all of its own, except the standard scores are
only available when scoring for every game of the domain is completed. Here is the
raw score table from the Examiner Form, which shows the games under each section:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Raw score table" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/itemslist.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's simulate one game from the fine motor domain to give you an idea of how the assessment is administered.
The game I've chosen is one that I find particularly challenging to administer. Not all
items are this complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Origami Game&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To prepare:&lt;/em&gt; Before the assessment session, you have removed the middle page
of the child's workbook and cut out the two origami templates. You also have 
your own origami templates, to use as a demo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You have on hand:&lt;/em&gt; the administration directions, the examiner record form, 
two terry towelling washcloths, your demo origami templates, the child's origami templates, and a stopwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Origami Demo" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/item-origamidemo.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Origami items for 4-7 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Administer the items:&lt;/em&gt; Following the wording in the administration directions (below),
you complete the practice item with the child using the washcloths, followed by 
the dog origami, and the fish origami.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Origami Game Administration 1" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/item-dog.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Origami Game Administration 2" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/item-fish.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scoring:&lt;/em&gt; Now, I hope you were paying attention to the child's hand use and to the
30 second time limit. Work done after the time limit doesn't count. Here is the 
scoring to complete:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Origami Game Scoring Page" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/item-origamiscoring.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you've finished all items in the 25 page Examiner Form (below), you can score it all up
and get standardised scores for each of the three "Performance" domains, and use the examiner form and the
manual to decide whether the child is performing at an age-appropriate level, or 
whether the child's skill development is delayed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="M-FUN examiner form upper age group" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/examinerform.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Examiner Form for the upper age group&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can collect back the Home Observations Checklist from a parent, and the Classroom
Observations Checklist from the teacher, and compare the results to your Test Observations
Checklist. I believe these checklists are the same for both age groups. These provide the
measure of "Participation".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Observations Checklists" src="/2016/01/13/mfun/obs-checklists.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you've had a taste of how the M-FUN is administered, let me share my
experiences in using it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things I Like:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The assessment appeals to children. It is actually fun, as it was designed to be.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It gives you LOTS of information about the child's physical development and function.
The Neurological Foundations profile allows the examiner to perform deeper analysis of
the child's function, which can be particularly helpful for intervention planning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is more holistic than other, similar assessments that concentrate solely on clinical acquisition of motor abilities.
The scores on the observations checklist can provide an indication as to how poor motor performance
affects their participation in the home and class settings. Again, this is very helpful for intervention planning.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The parts can be used separate from the whole assessment. For example, I can still
get standardised results for a child's VM and FM without doing the GM component or
observation checklists.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It covers all the basic skills I want to check for a child entering school, such as visual
scanning and tracking, pencil control, scissor skills, ability to sit at a table for
a length of time (45min), and following instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Things I Find Difficult:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While theoretically, this assessment can be done in a variety of settings (clinic,
home, school, etc.), this isn't always easy. I have found the gross motor section difficult,
as it requires prior set-up of measured lines and markers, and it requires a smooth wall
with a concrete floor against which a ball can be kicked for "Soccer". I've been unable to locate an
appropriate wall at several locations (homes and schools).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one item in a performance domain can't be completed, a standard score for the
domain cannot be calculated. Therefore, if the only suitable wall becomes unavailable (e.g. it starts raining) for the
Soccer game, a standardised GM score can't be obtained even for the upper body items, and
the time you've spent on the rest of the GM section becomes much less useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To administer this assessment, you have to be very organised. As you may have noticed in the
Origami example above, there are many different resources to juggle, and the examiner's
attention is constantly split between observing the child, checking the administration directions,
scoring ("how many fold is that? OK, four folds, but 2 weren't accurate, and maybe
that beautiful final fold was after the time limit… how do I score that??"),
and keeping time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because the children enjoy the assessment items, they want to finish their work. I like
children to finish their work too, but the time limits are very short for the children
I work with, and it's very difficult to stop them half way through every single item!
It's not great for rapport or for their sense of accomplishment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I've found it takes more preparation time than other assessments, and it takes longer to score,
compared to something simpler like the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="/2015/10/24/dtvp2-vs-dtvp3.html"&gt;DTVP-3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It's American. For example, one of the Classroom Observations Checklist items is about
whether the child can carry their tray in the cafeteria. This isn't relevant in most Australian schools.
I've modified this item to be "manages lunch box independently."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tips for Easier M-FUN Administration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In researching for this post, I've come across a 4 hour e-learning course by Dr Lucy Miller on using the M-FUN-PS.
It's available on the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://spduniversity.org/"&gt;SPD University website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for US$185, course #2301 and #2302. 
I'm planning to do them soon, so I'll let you know if they're helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It helps to have two people administering the assessment together. I have done it with a physio,
where we took turns between scoring/time-keeping and administering the tasks for the FM and GM sections. 
It's so much easier with two sets of eyes!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep your M-FUN kit ready to go, stocked with everything you need, and make a short
list somewhere (I wrote it in the front of the administration directions book) of the
things you need to gather for each assessment (i.e. fresh crackers, water and napkins for the
Snack Time item, cut out origami templates, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the child wants to take their handiwork with them, make sure you take a photo of it
so you can double-check your scoring if you need to. If possible, video the assessment (or parts)
so you can check things afterwards, particularly the first few times you administer it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I find the M-FUN to be very useful, when a rigorous assessment is
required. It is fun for the child and provides helpful information to the examiner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See my post about &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://otequip.info/2016/09/23/MFUN-elearning.html"&gt;M-FUN Online Learning Course&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, there are my thoughts. What are yours? Have you used the M-FUN-PS?
