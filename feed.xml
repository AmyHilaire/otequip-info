    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As occupational therapists, we often use equipment to solve problems and enable 
our clients to live their lives their way. To achieve this very broad goal, we 
require a broad range of equipment, much of it very specialised. But the world 
of disability equipment can be a daunting one. A good sales rep is like the hen 
that lays golden eggs. A poor one is like the hen that makes fertilizer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the equipment companies, good relationships with occupational therapists is 
good for business. We link the equipment company with clients and funding bodies. 
Without OTs facilitating access to funding, many clients would not be able to 
afford the expensive disability equipment the companies need to sell.
A good working relationship between OTs and Equipment Reps benefits everyone, so 
here is my recipe for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Amy's 7 Things" src="/2017/12/22/expectations-of-equipment-reps/7-things-I-expect-of-equipment-reps.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.	Offer a Good Range&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The products on offer is the first thing that will draw therapists to a company. 
What constitutes a good range depends on the type of company. For distribution 
companies that sell multiple brands, it is helpful if you stock several different 
products in each category so that we can compare them in one place. This saves time. 
For companies that sell their own brand, it is helpful if you have different levels 
of product, or products that can be adapted for different styles of use. 
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.neater.co.uk/"&gt;Neater Solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; does this well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.	Know your products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two things I want from a joint visit with an equipment rep: for the 
physical product to be present so my client can try it; and so that I can ask the 
rep questions about the product. The rep should know the product specifications 
better than I do. The rep should know what accessories are available, their 
dimensions, how much they cost, and how long it will take for them to be shipped. 
It is also helpful if the rep knows of creative ways the product has been used in 
the past, or ways to work around common problems that can occur with the product. 
For bonus points, know the competition so you can explain why your product is 
better or different.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.	Be honest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is something you don’t know about your product, don’t guess. Find out. 
If you know that your product isn’t going to work in this situation, with this client, be honest about it. 
Don’t add extras to quotations that haven’t been discussed. Be realistic about delivery times. 
Under-promise, over-deliver. This is all basic to offering a professional service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.	Trust the Occupational Therapist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what we’re talking about. We have invited an equipment rep to see a client 
with us for a specific reason, to achieve a specific goal. It may not always be 
apparent what that goal is, so you need to trust that we know what we’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rep’s expertise is in their product knowledge and experience with the using 
the products in different situations. The OT’s expertise is in all other parts 
of the situation: the client and their disability/medical condition, the environment, 
the applicable laws, policies and procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I consider it completely out of line 
if the rep gives my client advice. Demonstrating how to use the product is good 
and giving safety advice based on the manufacturer’s guidelines is expected. That is 
part of the rep’s role. But if the rep has ideas about how equipment should be 
positioned or about other things that don’t relate directly to the product, don’t 
advise the client. Discuss it with the therapist. Incorrect or inappropriate 
advice can cause harm, or in the least, confusion. If you cause my client harm, 
or make a mess that I need to clean up, I will not use your services again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.	Do what you say you’ll do&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Follow up. Follow through. If for any reason you can’t, let me know as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.	Don’t waste time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrive on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A company that can be relied upon to provide a quotation the same day I ask for it, 
will be used more than a company that takes longer. This is particularly true for 
small items or accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.	Be generous&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show the OTs you work with that you value the relationship by sponsoring events, 
sending Christmas gifts, and offering educational workshops. These things make us 
feel appreciated and increase our loyalty to your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;big thank you&lt;/strong&gt; to the wonderful reps I have worked with that raise the bar for
the rest of your industry. When things run smoothly, client outcomes improve and 
everyone is happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occupational therapists, please feel free to add to my list!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equipment reps, please let us know how we can make working together easier for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Importance of 24-hour Postural Care</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In July 2017, I attended the Posture and Mobility Group conference in Cardiff, Wales. 
I returned to London feeling inspired and refreshed. In that post-conference euphoria,
I wrote the following article for the PMG Journal. Edited by Olwen Ellis. 
Read the original &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pmguk.co.uk/journals/24-hour-postural-care"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a great little video that introduces 24-hour postural care, from Simple Stuff Works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CeWMltvzgOg?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love learning something at a conference that I can apply immediately to my work. 
A presentation that particularly struck me at the Posture &amp;amp; Mobility Group (PMG) 
Conference 2017 in Cardiff was &lt;strong&gt;A person-centred approach to the protection and restoration of body shape: how can equipment in sitting and lying help meet individual goals and changing needs to improve quality of life&lt;/strong&gt;, 
by Helena Poulton (occupational therapist) and Tess Ellis (physiotherapist).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their presentations put forward that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Body shape changes, such as pelvic rotation and distortion of the chest, can be predicted for people with movement difficulties. Gravity exerts a continuous force on everybody. Longer time spent in static positions increases the likelihood of body shape changes, due to the constant force of gravity on the body (Hill &amp;amp; Goldsmith, 2010).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When body shape changes affect the rib cage, it can cause respiratory difficulties. This may contribute to premature death for people with learning disabilities (Heslop, et al., 2013).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Postural care should include support for lying and sitting positions, as these are the positions used during the day by those most at risk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supporting people to sustain symmetrical positions is best for function and health.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We need to work towards symmetry within our clients' physical limits and within our clients' comfort and preference (Hill &amp;amp; Goldsmith, 2010).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supine is the only truly symmetrical posture for lying in a bed (Hill &amp;amp; Goldsmith, 2010). [If the client can’t tolerate sleeping supine, work towards minimising rotation and reducing stretch on hip ligaments in side lying].&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Posture management equipment needs to be flexible and sustainable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consideration should be given to off-the-shelf products that can be adapted (e.g. modular backrest systems) before custom moulded foam options, especially for clients who fluctuate in their condition, or who are likely to change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had assumed that adult body shape was relatively fixed, or a deteriorating condition 
that we could only slow down. In one case study, a woman showed improvement in body 
shape after several years of using a posture management system in bed. She had been 
measured recently using the Goldsmith indices of body symmetry 8 months apart, and 
showed an improvement in her ribcage shape and in her wind sweeping index. Whilst 
the positioning equipment at night can be adjusted as her body shape changes, she 
needed a flexible adaptable seating solution which would change as her body shape 
continues to improve.  The presenters were working with the local wheelchair service to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I returned to my workplaces enthused about restoring body shape for the many clients 
seen in our services with asymmetrical postures due to neurological disabilities. 
Two clients immediately came to mind that I believed could live longer from postural 
support in lying.  Both have respiratory problems. I went ahead and arranged a visit 
with a supplier, as I assumed that something so essential would naturally be funded. 
Discussing the cases with my seniors, however, I realised it’s not that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Jenx Dreama Postural Management System" src="/2017/09/28/24hr-postural-care/24hr-postural-care.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Example of a sleep positioning system for children: Jenx Dreama&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked in Queensland, Australia, postural sleep systems were funded the 
same way as wheelchairs and bathing equipment, by the Department of Health. In the 
London borough where I work now, sleep positioning systems for adults have historically 
been funded only through charitable organisations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Healthy body shape is fundamental for good breathing, circulation and digestion 
(Hill &amp;amp; Goldsmith, 2010). When people breath properly, they can do more and are 
less likely to require hospital admissions. How much does the cost of one sleep 
positioning system compare to the cost of a hospital admission for pneumonia, or 
new wheelchair and complex seating system every few years due to progression of 
body shape deformity? Prevention is better than cure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This new knowledge has motivated me to advocate for provision of postural management systems. 
I’m not the first therapist to try this, nor the most qualified, but it’s important that 
we keep saying it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="PMG logo" src="/2017/09/28/24hr-postural-care/PMG-colour.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you, PMG, for awakening me to the power 24-hour postural 
care has to improve quality of life and longevity. I have learnt valuable assessment 
skills and improved techniques for therapeutic positioning. I’m excited to be a 
member of such a fantastic organisation and I look forward to 
watching the conference presentations again online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since my recent posts about working in the UK, I've been getting lots of questions. 
Here are some Frequently Asked Questions, with some answers. Please feel free to
ask more by commenting at the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you ask your team leader for a professional reference for the HCPC
Application despite your move was months (more than six!) ahead?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found the task of asking my team leader for a reference quite daunting. 
I didn’t want them to worry about me leaving soon, when I didn’t have any firm plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, we have a good relationship, so that helped. I stayed late, after everyone 
else had left for the day, so we could speak privately. I said something along 
the lines of "Hi Liz, you know how I've been wanting to do some travelling. Well, 
I've decided to start the process of registering as an OT in the UK, just to open 
some options. We don't have any firm plans for moving yet." She was a little surprised 
but happy to help. Then I briefly explained the application process and showed her 
the professional reference form. She was happy to fill it in for me, so I left it 
with her for a few days. I also asked her not to tell anyone else about it, because 
it was all still a long way off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Should I look for and possibly secure a job whilst still working in Australia or
arrive in the UK and begin looking then? There are pros and cons of each. What did you do in your move? And how did it go for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When to apply depends on what kind of job you will be applying for. If you are 
planning to travel a lot, locum roles are best. Employers generally want locums 
to start as soon as possible (usually within a week or two), so I would advise waiting 
until you get over here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I accepted a locum role about a week before arriving in London. I only stayed in 
the job 4 weeks because it was so far from where we were staying and it was really 
hard to juggle work with basic things like setting up a bank account, getting a 
local phone number etc. It would have been much easier if I had 2-4 weeks to settle 
in and find my way around before starting work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that 4-week role, I had a break of about 4 weeks while I waited for a more 
suitable role to be offered by one of my agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are planning to apply for a permanent role or fixed contract directly with NHS, I 
would suggest applying about 2-3 months before you plan to travel. Their HR process is incredibly long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The agencies I've been in touch with (Sugarman, Mediplacements, Maxima etc) have
only mentioned Locums roles. What is the difference between all these agencies- do
they all have the same jobs available or are they different jobs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The health system here in the UK is split into NHS Trusts. Each trust has its own governance. 
A trust is sort of equivalent to an Australian local council area. There are normally one to 
three main hospitals within each trust, plus community services. Each trust might have 
"preferred suppliers" for various things, including temporary staff. If an agency 
is the preferred supplier, they will be told about the job first. If they can't fill 
it, it will be opened to other agencies. I haven't found a way to find out which 
agencies are the preferred suppliers for each trust. If the agency is "top tier" 
they are more likely to hear about jobs early. Sugarman is a top tier agency. I'm 
not sure about the other two, but they both have good reputations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recruitment agencies don’t have a very good reputation in Australia. Can you trust them in the UK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that the agency's main goal is to have you working. Not to make you happy. 
You are their product, not their customer. They get paid according to how many 
hours you work. Sometimes that means they will offer you jobs that you won't actually 
like, but they can make it sound like what you've asked for. Don't be afraid to 
ask lots of questions and to turn jobs down. There is plenty of work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, a good agency will also try to keep you happy by trying to understand 
exactly what type of role you're looking for, and only will contact you about suitable roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you primarily working with paediatrics or adults? I'm more of a paed therapist,
however I know with NHS it’s a bit of everything (as agencies have told me), did you find this the case?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like in Australia, there are different specialties. I've found job roles in 
the UK tend to be more specialised than in Australia. I have just been appointed 
to a permanent part time NHS role as a wheelchair therapist. I will only be prescribing 
wheelchairs. I have worked in paediatrics and with adults in UK and Australia. 
My other current role (part time) is working with adults with physical disabilities 
in the community, working through my agency with the Local Authority (the local council). 
I've always been a community therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did I answer your question? If not, please ask below, or see my other posts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Working Abroad Part 4: Limited Company or Umbrella Company?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE: Changes to the IR35 Intermediaries legislation, coming into effect for the 2017/2018 tax year, mean that working as an OT locum through a limited company is no longer an attractive option for me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the six weeks before I left Australia to start working in the UK, the agencies
started asking "Are you going with an umbrella company or a limited company?"
I was completely puzzled at why I needed either of them. How do they work?
What's the difference? And no one would give any guidance due to legal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Why do you NEED to choose one or the other?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working as a locum in the UK, you are a contractor. That is, you need to be
self-employed. The organisation you work for (e.g. the NHS or Social Services)
doesn't employ you, and the recruitment agency doesn't employ you. The organisation
contracts the agency to provide them with workers, and the agency contracts you,
the worker, to provide the service for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, you need a legal entity to act as your 'employer'. You can do it yourself, through
a Limited Company. Or you can have someone else do it for you: an Umbrella Company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="So many choices!" src="/2017/02/04/limited-company/girl-umbrella-bridge1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. What is the difference?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difference is in how you get paid, and your legal rights and obligations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Umbrella Company:&lt;/em&gt; You are an employee of the umbrella company. You submit your
timesheet and claimable expenses to the umbrella company. Your gross pay goes from
the agency to the umbrella company. They take out taxes and their fees.
They deposit your net pay into your bank account. I chose to set up my own limited company,
so I don't have any first-hand experience of umbrella companies. As you are an employee,
many umbrella company provide sick pay and other statutory benefits.
Some also include insurance cover and pension schemes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Limited Company:&lt;/em&gt; You are the sole employee, director and 100% shareholder of a 
limited company. See the diagram below. The recruitment agency pays your company,
and your company pays you (you pay yourself) salary, dividends, and reimbursable 
expenses. Your company pays Corporation Tax. You are your own employer. 
You are 100% legally responsible for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Limited Company Diagram" src="/2017/02/04/limited-company/GettingPaid1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Red = requests for payment, Black = payments&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know. It looks very confusing. It took me a little while to get my head around
how to process all the paperwork! I'm really glad to be with &lt;a href="https://incomemadesmart.com/"&gt;Income Made Smart (IMS)&lt;/a&gt;.
They helped me set up my company, and provide mentoring whenever I need it. They've been very helpful.
If you decide to use their service, please say I (Amy Hilaire) referred you. That would
really help to fund this blog!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legally, a limited company gives you more responsibility. I am the sole director
of my limited company. Therefore, it's my responsibility to ensure my company is
compliant with all legislation regarding employment and taxes etc. It seems complicated,
but IMS help a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. How to choose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, it's really down to personal preference, and risk versus return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good umbrella company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces your risk, because their trained professionals take care of all your tax etc and all you have to worry about is how to spend your take-home pay.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces your return (income). From what I've heard, umbrella companies charge a lot for their service, and your take-home pay is less than if you have a limited company.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;reduces your admin time a little. You still have to submit your timesheet and your expenses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A limited company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases your return. You're not paying anyone else to do admin for you. Your tax is generally less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I pay weekly fees to IMS to help me manage my company, but I believe this is much less.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases your risk, as you get no sick pay or included insurance, so it's up to you to keep savings aside for this. And you may have a personal tax bill at the end of the tax year, depending on your situation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;increases your options. For example, my company bought a laptop for me to use, pre-tax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Words of Warning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do your own research.&lt;/em&gt; It's very easy just to go with recommendations from your agency to find help with setting
up a limited company, or an umbrella companies to sign up with. Keep in mind
that the agencies get referral bonuses and may refer you to the companies that
pay the most for referrals rather than the one that is in your best interest.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The most important thing I learnt from the SPD University Miller Function and
Participation Scales webinars is that this assessment relies on the &lt;strong&gt;therapist’s clinical judgement&lt;/strong&gt; 
in the administration and scoring. Dr Lucy J Miller and
Dr Sarah Schoen, who ran the e-learning courses made it clear that the assessment is
supposed to be fun, and the goal is to get the child’s
best performance. And they mean it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started administrating the M-FUN, I was overly precise to avoid 
jeopardising the validity of the standardised results. I’ve
learnt now that the test was standardised in a way that means you &lt;strong&gt;can&lt;/strong&gt;
change things to suit the child without breaching standard administration.
For example, if a child is fatiguing significantly, you can split the assessment
into several sessions. You can change the order of the items so snack time comes
earlier if the child needs a break. Wow - it's such a relief to have this flexibility within a standardised assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The webinars included video examples. I found it useful to see other
therapists administering the assessment, though the videos were focused on
the children rather than the therapist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learnt that the M-FUN is designed to follow the ICF framework by measuring Body Structure and Function
(through the Foundations Profile), Activity (VM / FM / GM Performance measures) 
and Participation (Observations Checklists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="diagram" src="/2016/09/23/MFUN-elearning/ICFandMFUN.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is what I learnt to help combat the difficulties I was initially having
with the M-FUN:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 1:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;While theoretically, this assessment can be done in a variety of settings (clinic,
home, school, etc.), this isn't always easy. I have found the gross motor section
difficult, as it requires prior set-up of measured lines and markers, and it requires
a smooth wall with a concrete floor against which a ball can be kicked for "Soccer".
I've been unable to locate an appropriate wall at several locations (homes and schools).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It looks like I’m not the only person with this issue. In the clinic-based assessment
sessions shown in the webinars, the therapists were using a long hallway for the
soccer section. To me, it didn’t look like 12 feet away – but if that’s acceptable,
it makes my life easier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 2:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If one item in a performance domain can't be completed, a standard
score for the domain cannot be calculated. Therefore, if the only suitable wall
becomes unavailable (e.g. it starts raining) for the Soccer game, a standardised
GM score can't be obtained even for the upper body items, and the time you've spent
on the rest of the GM section becomes much less useful.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of options to combat this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Come back and do it again another day&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use your observations to comment on the parts the child completed. It’s not all about the scores.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 3:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;To administer this assessment, you have to be very organised. There
are many different resources to juggle, and the examiner's attention is constantly
split between observing the child, checking the administration directions, scoring,
and keeping time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel much less stressed about this now. When doing the assessment, it is assumed
that you will know it well enough not to need the administration directions in
front of you – there are hints on the score sheet, and the wording doesn’t have
to be used word for word, it’s just to give you the gist. Lucy and Sarah also
commented several times on how useful videoing sessions can be so you can complete scoring afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="So much writing" src="/2016/09/23/MFUN-elearning/writing.jpeg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 4:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Because the children enjoy the assessment items, they want to finish
their work. I like children to finish their work too, but the time limits are
very short for the children I work with, and it's very difficult to stop them
half way through every single item! It's not great for rapport or for their sense
of accomplishment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To combat this, I have been allowing the children to finish their work (in most
cases) and trying to note when the time ran out. As it turns out, this is what
we’re expected to do. You want the children to feel good about their efforts and
continue to do their best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 5:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I've found it takes more preparation time than other assessments,
and it takes longer to score, compared to something simpler like the DTVP-3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still true. I don’t think there’s really a way around it, due to the M-FUN's comprehensive nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Issue 6:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;It's American. For example, one of the Classroom Observations
Checklist items is about whether the child can carry their tray in the cafeteria.
This isn't relevant in most Australian schools. I've modified this item to be
"manages lunch box independently."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, that’s probably not going to change anytime soon. However, with the
guiding principals of the assessment in mind, such as basing on the ICF framework,
and focusing on measuring the child's best performance, I feel more justified in
modifying a few items to be more culturally or environmentally relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;* * *&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I found the webinars very helpful. I would recommend them as essential
viewing for anyone administering the M-FUN. You can find them &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://spduniversity.org/2013/05/13/session-2-administration-and-scoring-of-the-m-fun/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My original review of the M-FUN assessment is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://otequip.info/2016/01/13/mfun.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are my thoughts. Please share yours below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The UK is an attractive base for young Australians and New Zealanders
to gain international professional experience, while travelling the world. 
Locumming makes this dream a reality. In the UK, locum roles are filled through recruitment agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a Locum?&lt;/strong&gt; The term 'locum' refers to a person filling a role on a temporary basis. 
'Locumming' is when a contract worker uses short term contracts as a source of income. 
Locum work generally has a higher hourly pay rate, but doesn't include employment 
benefits such as sick leave, annual leave, or insurance.
Locum work is purely paid by the hour, like a casual employee. If you don't work, you don't get paid. 
On the flipside, the locum can choose to take time off at times that suit them, 
and contracts can be ended with one week notice. Locums fill in maternity leave positions,
complete short-term projects, or fill a role temporarily while a permanent employee is recruited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why use an Agency?&lt;/strong&gt; In order to do locum work, registering with at least one agency 
is essential. Agencies also provide helpful advice on moving, particularly if you don't know 
anyone in the UK, and/or haven't been there before (like me).
Most of the locums I've talked to are registered with up to three. There are a few reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While the agencies have many of the same jobs, some may specialise in different areas (geographical or organisational) and have roles that other agencies don't.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Larger agencies are generally useful for getting settled, as they have more staff and sometimes organise social events etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Smaller agencies may offer a slightly higher pay rate, so that you take the position through them rather than a larger agency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you become a limited company (which most locums prior to 2017 used to do) you will need to show that you are working as an independent contractor rather than as an employee. Working for more than one agency in the tax year makes your tax clearer in regards to IR35 (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://otequip.info/2017/02/04/limited-company.html"&gt;more info on limited companies here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Communication Diagram" src="/2016/09/07/working-holiday3/GettingWorkS.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Communication channels for locum work&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three agencies I’ve come across the most are &lt;a href="http://www.sugarman.co.uk/clients/specialisms/occupational-therapy"&gt;Sugarman&lt;/a&gt;, 
&lt;a href="http://www.justot.co.uk/"&gt;JustOT/JustPhysio&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.yourworldhealthcare.com/uk/professions/occupational-therapy"&gt;Your World&lt;/a&gt;. I’m registered with the first two, and I am well looked after. 
I also tried to register with a different one, but they lost contact. The NHS puts the agencies on different tiers, and prefer to deal with the ones at the top 
(which includes Sugarman and JustOT, and probably others), because they and their 
candidates (us) comply with strict NHS quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Registering with an agency&lt;/strong&gt; initially is quite easy: you just need to contact them, 
send in your resume, and let them know your plans. They will allocate you a consultant 
who will usually be keen to keep in touch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing the full registration is a bit more involved. This is what I had to submit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Birth certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Marriage certificate (to prove change of name)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Passport&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;HCPC Registration&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;University degree certificate&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;List of residential addresses covering the last 10 years&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete employment history (starting from my first job in high school)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Form to account for any gaps in employment of one month or more&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Australian Federal Police check&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Declaration that none of the members of my household have been convicted of criminal activities involving children&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Agency application form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health declaration form&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of childhood immunization (polio, measles, mumps, rubella, hep A, diphtheria, whooping cough) and appropriate boosters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of Hep B vaccination &amp;amp; immunity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of varicella immunity&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Proof of TB vaccination&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK police check (DBS)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Biometric Residence Permit (BRP)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2 proofs of UK address&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;National Insurance number (UK)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;UK company and bank details&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photo for ID card&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Certificate of completion of Mandatory Training&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be a pain to send in all this stuff by email, then also show them the originals. 
&lt;strong&gt;Advice: stay organised.&lt;/strong&gt; The consultants will keep you up to date with what they 
still need from you, but sometimes they forget or lose things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I finally completed and submitted all these things, I was labelled &lt;strong&gt;“Compliant”&lt;/strong&gt;. 
Oh, happy day! Now I can be contracted to work anywhere in the NHS quickly and easily, through either agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is long enough without going into more details. If you have questions, please ask :-)&lt;/p&gt;
