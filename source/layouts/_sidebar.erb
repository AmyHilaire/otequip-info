    <h2>Welcome to OT Equipment Info</h2>
    <p class="caption">Hi, I'm Amy. I've been an occupational therapist for over 5 years.
    Recently, I started learning to code, so I've made this site from scratch to 
    share my experiences with equipment, while learning some new skills. I hope you
    learn something new here.</p>
