The Jay cushion range, available from [Sunrise Medical](http://www.sunrisemedical.com.au/products/jay/wheelchair-cushions/jay-j2.aspx),
is a tried and true pillar of the wheelchair cushion world. While the J2 isn't suitable for *every* application, it allows
easy customisation with modular components, and the design works well for users
of many shapes, sizes, and postures.

are essential components. The fluid supplement pad and adductor wedges are examples 
of the many modular components available to assist with postural management.</p>

<p class="caption">The base has a large, deep well at the rear, allowing the user's bony prominences
(ischial tuberosities, sacrum and coccyx) to sink into the fluid. The lack of a 
firm back wall on the base removes all rub points for the sacrum.</p>

<p class="caption">The standard stretch cover is quick and easy to put on and remove. It is elasticated like
a fitted bedsheet. Velcro on the underside of the base and cover stops the cushion
sliding on the wheelchair seat.</p>
