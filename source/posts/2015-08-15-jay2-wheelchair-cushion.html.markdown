Anyone who needs to use a wheelchair should also be using a cushion on their
wheelchair, since they would presumably have impaired mobility, sensation, or 
both. If the user doesn't have impaired mobility or sensation, a cushion will 
at least improve the comfort of the wheelchair. The levels of pressure 
redistribution and postural support vary a lot between different types of
cushions. The table below is my general opinion, formed over several years of 
prescribing cushions for wheelchair users. I'm sure some of the manufacturers
and sales reps would disagree.
