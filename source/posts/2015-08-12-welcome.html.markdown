*A place for sharing ideas and experiences with equipment.*

If you were to look at a day in the life of an occupational therapist (OT), 
there's a good chance you'd come across specialised assistive equipment somewhere. 
OTs help people overcome obstacles such as illness, injury or disability to 
achieve a lifestlye that is meaningful to them. We do this by either *remediating* 
the problem, that is, helping the person recover, or *compensating* for the problem,
by finding a way to work around it. We love presribing equipment because [when done well]
it provides a way for people to do things independently, or with less assistance 
than they would otherwise need. 

Some benefits of using assistive equipment include:

* Enabling someone to do something they otherwise wouldn't be able to,
* Reducing the need for assistance, thereby preserving dignity and enhancing
self-efficacy,
* Improving safety and decreasing risk of injury to the person and others.

Choosing the right equipment can be a tedious task. OTs often have specific
measurements or features in mind that would promote the best possible outcome. 
The aim of **OT Equipment Info** is to make it easy for OTs to find information;
saving time and improving outcomes.
