Anyone who needs to use a wheelchair should also be using a cushion on their
wheelchair, since they would presumably have impaired mobility, sensation, or 
both. Without a cushion, the user would be at risk of developing a pressure injury.
If the user doesn't have impaired mobility or sensation, a cushion will 
at least improve the comfort of the wheelchair. The levels of pressure 
redistribution and postural support vary a lot between different types of
cushions. These two factors are the first that I consider when choosing cushions
to trial. The table below is a very basic comparison of the different types of 
cushions. It's my general opinion, formed over several years of prescribing
cushions for wheelchair users. It's not an all-inclusive list, just the cushions
I've come across most often. I intend to add more to this table as I become
familiar with a wider range.

To assess the level of pressure redistribution the user needs in a cushion, I
would do a recognised assessment such as a Waterlow Scale, or an informal 
assessment. Either way, main factors to consider include duration of sitting (mobility),
history of pressure areas, general health, amount of "bottom padding" (someone who
is very bony or very overweight generally has higher risk), and skin integrity.

To assess the level of postural support/adjustment required, I would consider
balance, core strength, symmetry (scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, pelvic rotation), 
sitting posture when unsupported (if possible). If the user sits asymmetrically
I would generally look at prescribing one of the cushions I've listed in the
high-level postural support category because most of them are relatively easy to
customise to suit the users needs. For someone who tends to sacral sit (C-curve of
the back), a wedge under almost any cushion to bring their knees up relative to
their hips is worth a try.

Other factors to consider when choosing a cushion include:

* Incontinence: look for a waterproof, easy to clean cover; make sure you get a
spare cover, or consider a cushion design that's very easy to clean, such as the
Stimulite or Equagel.
* Weight: for someone who has spent a lot to purchase an ultra-lightweight wheelchair,
consider avoiding a heavy gel cushion. Likewise, if the user will be lifting
the cushion on and off the chair regularly (e.g. for transporting in the car).
* Maintenance & Durability: Some cushions require regular maintenance and monitoring to check
they are working optimally (e.g. ROHO), whereas others just need the cover washed
occasionally. Choose a cushion that the user(s) can manage.

The most important thing in choosing a cushion is to **try it out!** Having the user
trial it, even for a few minutes, can save a lot of time down the track.
