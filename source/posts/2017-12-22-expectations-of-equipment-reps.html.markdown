As occupational therapists, we often use equipment to solve problems and enable 
our clients to live their lives their way. To achieve this very broad goal, we 
require a broad range of equipment, much of it very specialised. But the world 
of disability equipment can be a daunting one. A good sales rep is like the hen 
that lays golden eggs. A poor one is like the hen that makes fertilizer. 

For the equipment companies, good relationships with occupational therapists is 
good for business. We link the equipment company with clients and funding bodies. 
Without OTs facilitating access to funding, many clients would not be able to 
afford the expensive disability equipment the companies need to sell.
A good working relationship between OTs and Equipment Reps benefits everyone, so 
here is my recipe for success.

![Amy's 7 Things](/2017/12/22/expectations-of-equipment-reps/7-things-I-expect-of-equipment-reps.jpg)

**1.	Offer a Good Range**

The products on offer is the first thing that will draw therapists to a company. 
What constitutes a good range depends on the type of company. For distribution 
companies that sell multiple brands, it is helpful if you stock several different 
products in each category so that we can compare them in one place. This saves time. 
For companies that sell their own brand, it is helpful if you have different levels 
of product, or products that can be adapted for different styles of use. 
**[Neater Solutions](http://www.neater.co.uk/)** does this well.

**2.	Know your products**

There are two things I want from a joint visit with an equipment rep: for the 
physical product to be present so my client can try it; and so that I can ask the 
rep questions about the product. The rep should know the product specifications 
better than I do. The rep should know what accessories are available, their 
dimensions, how much they cost, and how long it will take for them to be shipped. 
It is also helpful if the rep knows of creative ways the product has been used in 
the past, or ways to work around common problems that can occur with the product. 
For bonus points, know the competition so you can explain why your product is 
better or different. 

**3.	Be honest**

If there is something you don’t know about your product, don’t guess. Find out. 
If you know that your product isn’t going to work in this situation, with this client, be honest about it. 
Don’t add extras to quotations that haven’t been discussed. Be realistic about delivery times. 
Under-promise, over-deliver. This is all basic to offering a professional service.

**4.	Trust the Occupational Therapist**

We know what we’re talking about. We have invited an equipment rep to see a client 
with us for a specific reason, to achieve a specific goal. It may not always be 
apparent what that goal is, so you need to trust that we know what we’re doing.

The rep’s expertise is in their product knowledge and experience with the using 
the products in different situations. The OT’s expertise is in all other parts 
of the situation: the client and their disability/medical condition, the environment, 
the applicable laws, policies and procedures. 

I consider it completely out of line 
if the rep gives my client advice. Demonstrating how to use the product is good 
and giving safety advice based on the manufacturer’s guidelines is expected. That is 
part of the rep’s role. But if the rep has ideas about how equipment should be 
positioned or about other things that don’t relate directly to the product, don’t 
advise the client. Discuss it with the therapist. Incorrect or inappropriate 
advice can cause harm, or in the least, confusion. If you cause my client harm, 
or make a mess that I need to clean up, I will not use your services again.

**5.	Do what you say you’ll do**

Follow up. Follow through. If for any reason you can’t, let me know as soon as possible. 

**6.	Don’t waste time**

Arrive on time.

A company that can be relied upon to provide a quotation the same day I ask for it, 
will be used more than a company that takes longer. This is particularly true for 
small items or accessories.

**7.	Be generous**

Show the OTs you work with that you value the relationship by sponsoring events, 
sending Christmas gifts, and offering educational workshops. These things make us 
feel appreciated and increase our loyalty to your company.
