The Miller Function and Participation Scales (M-FUN-PS) is a standardised developmental 
assessment for children aged 2 years and 6 months, to 7 years and 11 months. It
covers three motor domains: visual motor (VM), fine motor (FM), and gross motor (GM),
as well as participation. The M-FUN-PS was authored by Dr. Lucy Miller, a very 
experienced occupational therapist and researcher. 
Dr Miller has done a lot of work in the area of sensory processing disorder (SPD),
and has founded the SPD Foundation, the STAR Centre for SPD treatment, and the SPD
University, which provides online education to caregivers, the community, and health professionals. The M-FUN-PS
was published by [Pearson Clinical](https://www.pearsonclinical.com.au/products/view/143#tabs=0) in 2006,
and can be purchased through the Pearson website.

I've been using the M-FUN-PS (or M-FUN for short) for about 18 months. We decided 
to purchase the M-FUN as a replacement for our old Peabody Developmental Motor Scales,
which had pieces missing and included some rather out-dated activities (which some may call "classic",
but we were finding children commonly found test materials unfamiliar). We wanted an
assessment that could provide detailed results for parents and teachers, with the child's transition
to school in mind. The main purpose for this assessment in my setting has been to
prepare for or assist the child's transition to their first year of formal schooling
("Prep" in Queensland).

The M-FUN is split into two age levels, 2yrs 6mths until the child turns 4, then 4yrs
until the child turns 8. As transition to school occurs in Queensland between 5yrs 6mths
and 6yrs 6mths, I have never administered the younger version of the assessment.

<p class="caption">The two age groups complete the same items, with the tasks
simplified accordingly for the younger group.</p>

In my opinion, it's quite a long and detailed assessment
to consider administering with such a young age group, particularly with children who have
developmental delays. Even the younger version includes letter writing, which I would
consider to be developmentally beyond that age group.

<p class="caption">The workbooks and examiner forms are different for the lower 
and upper age ranges. The covers and layout are very motivating for children.</p>

The M-FUN kit includes many motivating and familiar items for children. The manipulatives (below)
come with the M-FUN set, or you can put together your own set by following the list in
the assessment manual. We found that we needed to replace some of the included items
with locally sources items, which worked better. For example, the "soft modelling clay"
included in our kit was rock hard, and even the therapists had trouble moulding it.
We have replaced it with standard plasticine.

The M-FUN domains (Visual Motor, Fine Motor, and Gross Motor) are made up of multiple
games each. Each game is like a subtest all of its own, except the standard scores are
only available when scoring for every game of the domain is completed. Here is the
raw score table from the Examiner Form, which shows the games under each section:

![Raw score table](/2016/01/13/mfun/itemslist.jpg)

Let's simulate one game from the fine motor domain to give you an idea of how the assessment is administered.
The game I've chosen is one that I find particularly challenging to administer. Not all
items are this complex. 

**The Origami Game**

*To prepare:* Before the assessment session, you have removed the middle page
of the child's workbook and cut out the two origami templates. You also have 
your own origami templates, to use as a demo. 

*You have on hand:* the administration directions, the examiner record form, 
two terri-towling washcloths, your demo origami templates, the child's origami templates, and a stopwatch.

<p class="caption">Origami items for 4-7 year olds.</p>

*Administer the items:* Following the wording in the administration directions (below),
you complete the practice item with the child using the washcloths, followed by 
the dog origami, and the fish origami.

*Scoring:* Now, I hope you were paying attention to the child's hand use and to the
30 second time limit. Work done after the time limit doesn't count. Here is the 
scoring to complete:

Once you've finished all items in the 25 page Examiner Form (below), you can score it all up
and get standardised scores for each of the three "Performance" domains, and use the examiner form and the
manual to decide whether the child is performing at an age-appropriate level, or 
whether the child's development of certain skills is is delayed.

You can collect back the Home Observations Checklist from a parent, and the Classroom
Observations Checklist from the teacher, and compare the results to your Test Observations
Checklist. I believe these checklists are the same for both age groups. These provide the
measure of "Participation".

Now that you've had a taste of how the M-FUN is administered, let me share my
experiences in using it.

**Things to Like:**

* The assessment appeals to children. It is actually fun, as it was designed to be.
* It gives you LOTS of information about the child's physical development and function.
The Neurological Foundations profile allows the examiner to perform deeper analysis of
the child's function, which can be particularly helpful for intervention planning.
* It is more holistic than other, similar assessments that concentrate soley on development.
The scores on the observations checklist can provide an indication as to how poor motor performance
affects their participation in the home and class settings. Again, this is very helpful for intervention planning.
* The parts can be used separate from the whole assessment. For example, I can still
get standardised results for a child's VM and FM without doing the GM component or
observation checklists.
* It covers all the basic skills I want to check for a child entering school, such as visual
scanning and tracking, pencil control, scissor skills, ability to sit at a table for
a length of time (45min), and following instructions.


**Things I Find Difficult:**

* While theoretically, this assessment can be done in a variety of settings (clinic,
home, school, etc), this isn't always easy. I have found the gross motor section difficult,
as it requires prior set-up of measured lines and markers, and it requires a smooth wall
with a concrete floor against which a ball can be kicked for "Soccer". I've been unable to locate an
appropriate wall at several locations (homes and schools).
* If one item in a performance domain can't be completed, a standard score for the
domain cannot be calculated. Therefore, if the only suitable wall becomes unavailable (e.g. it starts raining) for the
Soccer game, a standardised GM score can't be obtained even for the upper body items, and
the time you've spent on the rest of the GM section becomes much less useful.
* To administer this assessment, you have to be very organised. As you may have noticed in the
Origami example above, there are many different resources to juggle, and the eximiner's
attention is constantly split between observing the child, checking the administration directions,
scoring ("how many fold is that? OK, four folds, but 2 weren't accurate, and maybe
that beautiful final fold was after the time limit... how do I score that??"),
and keeping time.
* Because the children enjoy the assessment items, they want to finish their work. I like
children to finish their work too, but the time limits are very short for the children
I work with, and it's very difficult to stop them half way through every single item!
It's not great for rapport or for their sense of accomplishment.
* I've found it takes more preparation time than other assessments, and it takes longer to score,
compared to something simpler like the [DTVP-3](/2015/10/24/dtvp2-vs-dtvp3.html)
* It's American. For example, one of the Classroom Observations Checklist items is about
whether the child can carry their tray in the cafeteria. This isn't relevant in most Australian schools.
I've modified this item to be "manages lunch box independently."


**Tips for Easier M-FUN Administration:**

* In researching for this post, I've come across a 4 hour e-learning course by Dr Lucy Miller on using the M-FUN-PS.
It's available on the [SPD University website](http://spduniversity.org/) for US$185, course #2301 and #2302. 
I'm planning to do them soon, so I'll let you know if they're helpful.
* It helps to have two people administering the assessment together. I have done it with a physio,
where we took turns between scoring/time-keeping and administering the tasks for the FM and GM sections. 
It's so much easier with two sets of eyes!
* Keep your M-FUN kit ready to go, stocked with everything you need, and make a short
list somewhere (I wrote it in the front of the administration directions book) of the
things you need to gather for each assessment (i.e. fresh crackers, water and napkins for the
Snack Time item, cut out origami templates, etc).
* If the child wants to take their handiwork with them, make sure you take a photo of it
so you can double-check your scoring if you need to. If possible, video the assessment (or parts)
so you can check things afterwards, particularly the first few times you administer it.


Overall, I find the M-FUN to be very useful, when a rigorous assessment is
required. It is fun for the child and provides helpful information to the examiner.

Well, there are my thoughts. What are yours? Have you used the M-FUN-PS?
